title: Downgrading to a free user account plan

<Note>

**Note:** This article only applies to users of the public npm registry.

</Note>

If you have a paid user account, but no longer need private packages, you can downgrade your paid organization to a free organization. When you downgrade from a paid to a free organization, you will lose the ability to install and publish private packages at the end of your last paid billing cycle. Your private packages will _not_ be made publicly visible when you downgrade to a free plan.
