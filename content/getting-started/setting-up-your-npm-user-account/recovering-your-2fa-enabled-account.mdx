title: Recovering your 2FA-enabled account
---

When you have two-factor access enabled on your account, and you lose access to your 2FA device, you may be able to recover your account using the following methods.

## Misplaced second factor device
If you have misplaced the device that provided second-factor authentication, you can use the recovery codes generated when you [enabled 2FA][setup-recovery-codes] to access your account.

### Using recovery code on the web
1. Locate the recovery codes generated that you have saved.

2. <Shared.user_login.text />

   <Shared.user_login.image />

3. Click on "Use recovery code" from the next screen

   _Note: If you have configured to use TOTP, you will see an TOTP prompt instead_

4. Enter an unused recovery code in the "Use a Recovery Code" prompt

5. You are now logged into npm.

5. Follow the steps mentioned in "[Removing 2FA on the web][removing-2fa-on-the-web]" to disable 2FA

### Using recovery code from the command line

1. Locate the recovery codes generated when you enabled 2FA on your account.

2. If you are logged out on the command line, log in using `npm login` command with your username and npm password.

5. Enter an unused recovery code when you see this prompt:

   <Prompt>Enter one-time password:</Prompt>

4. Once you are logged in, use the below and enter your npm password if prompted.  

   ```
   npm profile disable-2fa
   ```

5. Enter another unused recovery code when you see this prompt:

   <Prompt>Enter one-time password:</Prompt>

5. npm will confirm that two-factor authentication has been disabled.

6. Follow the steps outlined in "[Configuring two-factor authentication][configuring-two-factor-authentication]" to re-enable 2FA and generate new recovery codes.

<Note>

**Note:** Using the recovery codes to re-enable 2FA may create a new authenticator account with the same npm account name.

If you are using a [time-based one-time password (TOTP)][totp] mobile app and want to delete the old authenticator account, follow the steps for the authenticator.

</Note>

## Viewing and regenerating recovery code

<Note>

**Note:**  Once you regenerate a set of code, all previous recovery codes become invalid. Each code can be used only once.

</Note>

1. <Shared.user_login.text />

   <Shared.user_login.image />

2. <Shared.account_settings.text />

   <Shared.account_settings.image />

3. On the account settings page, under "Two-Factor Authentication", click **Modify 2FA**.

   <Screenshot src="/getting-started/setting-up-your-npm-user-account/2fa-modify.png" alt="Screenshot showing Modify 2FA button" />

4. Click "Manage Recovery Codes'' to view your recovery codes

   <Screenshot src="/getting-started/setting-up-your-npm-user-account/view-recovery-codes.png" alt="Screenshot showing existing recovery codes and a button to generate set of recovery codes" />

5. Click "Regenerate Code" to generate a new set of codes.
