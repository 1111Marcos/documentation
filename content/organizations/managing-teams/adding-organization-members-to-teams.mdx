As an organization owner or team admin, you can add organization members to teams to give them access to a specific set of packages governed by the organization.

<Note>

**Note:** An npm user must be a member of your organization before you can add them to a team. To add a member to your organization, see "[Adding members to your organization][add-organization-members]".

**Note:** organization members are not notified when they are added to a team. We recommend telling the organization member you have added them to a team.

## Managing teams from the CLI

If you would like to manage the membership of your team from
the command line interface (CLI), you can use:

```
npm team
```

For more information, see the [CLI documentation on teams][team-cli].
