title: Removing teams
---

As an organization owner or team admin, you can remove teams that no longer need access to a set of packages governed by your organization. Removing the team will not remove the team members or packages from your organization.

<Note>
<><strong>Note:</strong> if you remove all teams referencing a particular package, it will be orphaned and you will lose access to it. If this happens, {shared['contact-support'].text}.</>
