**Note:** This article only applies to users of the public npm registry.

If you are a subscriber to the npm Teams product (you have a paid organization) and you are an owner of the organization, then you can downgrade from npm Teams to a free organization.  When you downgrade from a paid to a free organization, you and your organization members will lose the ability to install and publish private packages at the end of your last paid billing cycle. Your private packages will _not_ be made publicly visible when you downgrade to a free plan.

**Note:** If you would like to pay for fewer seats, you can remove members from your organization by following the steps in "[Removing members from your organization][remove-members]".
