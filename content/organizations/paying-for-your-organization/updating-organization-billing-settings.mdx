**Note:** This article only applies to users of the public npm registry.

As an owner of an npm Teams subscription, a paid organization plan, you can update the credit card used to pay for your plan. Updating your credit card will not change your billing cycle date, and the new credit card will be charged on the next billing cycle.

<Note>
<><strong>Note:</strong> If the credit card used to pay for your npm Teams subscription or your paid organization plan expires, or we are otherwise are unable to charge your card, you have a grace period of {shared['grace-period'].text} to update the card.</>

## Updating billing receipt email and extra receipt information

As an organization owner, you can update the email address used for receipts, and add extra information to the receipt for your paid organization plan, such as your business name, VAT identification number, or address of record. Updated billing information will appear on all receipts immediately.

<Note>

**Note:** The billing email is used for receipts only and is not required to match the email address of the person whose card is used to pay for the organization.
